            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Firenze Knitwear is a premier manufacturer specializing in fully-fashioned knitwear for women, men, and children. Backed by over 25 years of collective experience, our team is deeply passionate about craftsmanship, quality, and delivering exceptional knitwear to clients around the world. <br><br>

Headquartered in Madagascar—with dedicated sales offices in the UK and sourcing operations in Hong Kong—we proudly partner with leading fashion labels and prestigious department stores across global markets. Our products benefit from duty-free access to numerous countries including those in Europe, the USA, Canada, Japan, South Africa, and beyond. <br><br>

At the heart of Firenze Knitwear’s success is the synergy between our partners, sales teams, designers, and merchandisers. This close-knit collaboration ensures seamless execution from concept to finished garment, consistently upholding high standards of both design and service.<br><br>

Our production capabilities are powered by a versatile range of knitting machines, enabling us to work across various yarns, gauges, and textures. This flexibility allows us to craft garments tailored precisely to our clients’ needs. Madagascar’s long-standing heritage in knitwear craftsmanship adds a unique dimension to our collections, as we integrate traditional hand techniques—such as crochet and embroidery—alongside state-of-the-art computerized knitting technology.<br><br>

One of our core strengths lies in our in-house dyeing facility, which supports a wide array of dyeing techniques using raw materials readily available in stock. We also source top-dyed yarns from highly reputable suppliers in Italy, the UK, and China, ensuring both variety and consistency in color and texture.<br><br>

With a blend of heritage, innovation, and a relentless focus on quality, Firenze Knitwear is proud to be a trusted partner to some of the most respected names in fashion.
