            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Firenze Knitwear is a premier manufacturer specializing in fully-fashioned knitwear for women, men, and children. Founded in 2024 by a passionate entrepreneur, the company has quickly made a name for itself in the global fashion industry.

<br><br>Our headquarters are located in Madagascar, with additional offices for sales in the UK and sourcing in Hong Kong. We are proud to collaborate with many renowned fashion labels and department stores across the globe.

Our products benefit from duty-free access to a wide range of countries, including Europe, the USA, Canada, Japan, South Africa, and many more.

What truly drives our success is the strong synergy between our partners, sales teams, designers, and merchandisers. This close-knit collaboration ensures we consistently deliver high-quality results.

Thanks to this teamwork, we have developed a reputation for excellence in both craftsmanship and service standards.

<br><br>Equipped with a versatile range of knitting machines, we have the flexibility to work with various yarns, gauges, and textures—tailoring every piece to meet our clients’ expectations.

Madagascar is known for its skilled knitwear artisans, and we proudly incorporate traditional hand-knitting techniques such as crochet and embroidery into our collections. Complementing this heritage, we also utilize cutting-edge computerized knitting technology for added precision and efficiency.

One of our key strengths is our in-house dyeing facility, which allows us to offer a wide variety of dyeing options using raw materials we keep readily available in stock. Additionally, we source top-dyed yarns from trusted, high-quality suppliers in Italy, the UK, and China.

<br><br>As a company committed to social responsibility, we place great importance on ethical practices and environmental sustainability. Most of our production facilities are certified by the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI). We are constantly working to enhance labor conditions, promote workplace safety, and ensure the well-being of our employees.
